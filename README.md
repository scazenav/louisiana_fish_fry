Louisiana Fish Fry Products - Trade Event Analysis

Project Overview

This project is a hypothetical analysis designed to evaluate the effectiveness of trade events for Louisiana Fish Fry products using synthetic data and illustrative examples. The dataset consists of simulated sales records from 2021 to 2024, aimed at deriving insights into the impact of promotional activities and seasonal influences on product sales.

Dataset

The project dataset consists entirely of synthetic data designed to simulate:

	•	Product Sales (2021-2024): Includes sales records for Louisiana Fish Fry product categories, with details like pricing, promotional impacts, and sales volumes.
	•	Product Categories and SKUs: Product details, such as product names and SKUs (UPC codes), are used to create realistic scenarios for analysis.
	•	Customer Segmentation: The data includes different customer segments (Budget, Mainstream, Gourmet) for targeted marketing analysis.
	•	External Factors: Includes holiday effects and synthetic weather conditions to simulate their influence on product demand.

Features

	•	Trade Event Analysis: Assess the impact of hypothetical promotions on synthetic product sales.
	•	Seasonality & Trend Analysis: Explore simulated seasonal sales patterns and long-term trends.
	•	Customer Segmentation Analysis: Analyze the behavior of different customer groups.
	•	Predictive Modeling: Use simple machine learning models to demonstrate hypothetical sales performance based on synthetic historical data.

Installation

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/username/louisiana-fish-fry-analysis.git


	2.	Navigate into the project directory:

cd louisiana-fish-fry-analysis


	3.	Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt



Usage

	1.	Data Generation:
Open data_generation.ipynb to create a synthetic dataset. The notebook generates sales data with a 3-year period (2021-2024), incorporating different product categories and customer behaviors.
	2.	Exploratory Analysis:
Use exploratory_analysis.ipynb to explore the generated dataset, visualize sales trends, and understand customer segmentation.
	3.	Trade Event Analysis:
The trade_event_analysis.ipynb notebook evaluates hypothetical trade promotions to understand their impact on sales.
	4.	Running Scripts:
Scripts in the scripts/ folder can be used for automating parts of the analysis:

python scripts/train_model.py



Data Analysis Approach

	1.	Synthetic Data Generation:
A synthetic dataset is generated to simulate realistic sales data for Louisiana Fish Fry products. Parameters such as promotional impacts, seasonality, and pricing are included to make the dataset more representative.
	2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizations using matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly help uncover patterns and insights into customer behaviors and promotional impacts.
	3.	Modeling:
Basic machine learning models are used to predict sales trends:
	•	Clustering: K-Means clustering is used for hypothetical customer segmentation.
	•	Regression Models: Linear regression is used to illustrate how factors like seasonality and promotions might impact sales.

Results

	•	Hypothetical Insights: The synthetic dataset provides hypothetical insights into the impact of trade events and seasonality on product sales.
	•	Customer Behavior: Hypothetical segmentation suggests differing buying behaviors between Budget, Mainstream, and Gourmet customers.
	•	Promotional Effectiveness: Synthetic ROI calculations for promotional events to illustrate possible outcomes.
